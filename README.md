Happy Kimchi Token ($ kimchi) is a community driven DeFi token. Why do we name it Happy Kimchi? Kimchi is a type of food that is high in nutrients, a full of beta-carotene and other antioxidant compounds that can help reduce the risk of serious health conditions such as stroke, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Good health produces a happy life. Our finances are the same, having a good source of income and huge profits indirectly produce a happy life. This inspired us to create a healthy decentralized finance that will bring benefits and create happiness and joy to its hodler.
“We believe through the power of collective decentralization we can build something stronger than a centralized team ever could create. A community-driven token is nothing without the united individuals who give it purpose.”
Our Vision: Defi platform for everyone

We can see the rate of economic growth is very alarming in this time of pandemic. Many have been laid off and some have had to close their businesses. Opportunities in virtual business are increasing and indirectly creating a new norms in business dealings.

The latest technology in the financial system is to use blockchain technology and Happy Kimchi ($ kimchi) sees the opportunity to be on the payment gateway. Based on a study conducted by KPMG, only 27% of the ASEAN population has a bank account compared to 63% of internet access in ASEAN countries. This shows smartphone users outnumber bank account holders.

Opening a metamask or trust wallet account is easier than a bank account, secure and has instant transaction details. With the help of tutorials on youtube, it is easier to educate new users.

By increasing the use of cryptocurrency, we will be able to make “bank the unbanked / underbanked” a reality. We believe the Happy Kimchi ($kimchi) community, is able to create DeFi as a platform for everyone.


Our Mission: Easy, fun and profitable platform

When you combine easy, fun and profitable, you will get hobby that generates income with a lucrative profit. How do we combine these three elements into one? Easy, NFT market. So our focus at Happy Kimchi ($ kimchi) is to combine the concepts of DeFi and NFT in one platform.

Apart from the NFT market, we will focus on several other projects that also have the same impact such as online shopping, agriculture; from small pot farming hobbies to farms, electricity; from paying to receiving income and properties.
